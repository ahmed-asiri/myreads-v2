# Getting Started with ReadMore Project

This project is running the scope of your choosing books to read and schedule them for future reading. This project inspired by Udacity React nanodegree program.

## Running the Project locally

First of all, try cloning the project from Github: `git clone https://github.com/ahmed-asiri/myreads-v2.git`

To run the project in your enviroment, you can follow:

1. `npm install`: To install all project dependencies.
2. `npm start`: To run the project locally.

Check more available scripts in next section.

## Available Scripts To run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Technology Stack

- React for front-end
- backend server built by Udacity with open APIs.
- Tailwind CSS
- Husky for commit linting.
